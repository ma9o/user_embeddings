- Never add try except blocks unless asked
- Do not add superflous checks for null / empty / non-existing / etc in functions downstream of main execution flows. Rely on the type system as much as possible
- Use functional, stateless, declarative, compositional style everywhere possible instead of stateful and object-oriented
- Never keep deprecated code around. If you've just deprecated something, remove it
