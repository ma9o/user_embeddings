Your goal is to analyze ALL comments made by a target user within the provided conversational context and produce a set of distinct, factual, self-contained labels describing the user\\'s contribution in EACH of those comments.\\n\\nInput:\\n1. target_user_name: The user whose comments are being analyzed.\\n2. user_context: A YAML structure representing the conversation thread.\\n\\nCore Task: For EACH comment by the target_user_name within the user_context:\\n    A. Deconstruct that comment into its individual informational or intentional components relative to the immediate preceding context.\\n    B. Synthesize a separate, complete, contextually-grounded sentence (label) for each component identified in (A).\\n\\nProcess to Follow:\\n\\n1.  Identify Target Comments: Locate all comments authored by GoldenChrysus within the user_context YAML structure.\\n2.  Iterate and Analyze Each Target Comment: Process each identified target comment one by one, considering its specific placement and the comment(s) immediately preceding it.\\n    *   Context Analysis: For the current target comment being analyzed, understand the specific points, questions, or situation presented in the comment(s) immediately preceding it.\\n    *   Target Comment Deconstruction: Identify the distinct assertions, questions, reactions, intentions, or information units expressed within *this specific comment\\'s* body.\\n    *   Label Synthesis (For EACH deconstructed component of the current comment):\\n        *   CRITICAL Rule #1: Ensure Self-Containment: Each label MUST be fully understandable independently. It must contain all necessary context within itself. Do NOT use pronouns or references that depend on other labels. REPEAT CONTEXT verbatim if necessary for clarity and independence (e.g., start multiple labels with \"Responding to the claim that X...\" if they address different facets of that same claim).\\n        *   Contextual Framing: Begin the sentence by establishing the necessary context from the preceding interaction (e.g., \"Regarding the proposal...\", \"Responding to the point about Y...\", \"In the context of Z...\").\\n        *   Identify Contribution: State clearly what the USER did or expressed *in this specific part of this comment*. Use \"USER\" as the subject. Use precise action verbs (identifies, clarifies, argues, asks, confirms, predicts, disputes, provides, seeks, etc.). Avoid \"says,\" \"states.\"\\n        *   Incorporate Substance: Include the specific details/content of the user\\'s contribution from this part of the comment, linking it to the context.\\n        *   Appropriate Granularity: Combine minor details supporting one point into one label. Separate labels for fundamentally different points/actions within the same comment.\\n\\nChain of Thought Output (Mandatory): Before the final JSON output, you MUST provide your reasoning. \\n\\nFinal JSON Output: After the chain_of_thought block, provide the final JSON array containing all the synthesized string labels aggregated from all processed comments.\\n\\nExample 1:\\n\\ntitle: Took a break from the grinder and hand rolled some packaging.\\nsubmission_body: \\'[Link Post]\\'\\nsubreddit: Bladesmith\\nreplies:\\n- author: paulrckw\\n  body: I\\'d like to say this was easy but I\\'d be lying.
