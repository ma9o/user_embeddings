# Core Assumptions and Approach Details

## 1. Goal: Universal & Adaptable User Embeddings

*   **Assumption:** It's possible to create a universal user embedding model trained on rich interaction data that captures nuanced user states, interests, and behaviors.
*   **Adaptability:** This universal embedding should be directly adaptable for downstream tasks, particularly user-item recommendation, potentially using a Q&A framing inspired by models like Gecko.
*   **Motivation:** Move beyond task-specific models or models relying on simplified inputs (like SoMeR's feature triplets) to leverage the richness of conversational data for more versatile and accurate user representation.

## 2. Data Source & Semantic Unit: Contextual Reddit Threads

*   **Assumption:** The most informative signal for user understanding lies not just in *what* they post, but the *context* in which they post it (submission, parent comments, replies).
*   **Approach:** Utilize the Reddit Pushshift dataset. The primary semantic unit for analysis and input generation will be a structured representation of a user's comment along with its surrounding thread context (submission title/body, parent authors/bodies).
*   **Motivation:** Unlike approaches that abstract features early (e.g., SoMeR's PCA on embeddings), preserving the textual context allows for capturing fine-grained interests, opinions, and interaction dynamics essential for specific recommendations and nuanced understanding. This rich context is well-suited for processing by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 3. Processing & Training Signal Generation: LLM Teacher & Hierarchical Summaries

*   **Assumption:** A powerful "teacher" LLM (akin to Gecko's approach) can effectively distill meaningful training signals from the complex contextual interaction units.
*   **Approach (Explicit Rejection of Pre-clustering):** We will *not* perform explicit clustering of interaction embeddings before LLM processing. The LLM teacher will process individual contextual interaction units directly.
    *   **Motivation:** Simplifies the pipeline, avoids potential biases introduced by clustering algorithms, and leverages the LLM's capability to understand context without pre-grouping.
*   **Approach (Target Generation):** The LLM teacher will be prompted to generate **hierarchical, item-like summaries** for each relevant user interaction unit. This means producing:
    *   **1. A Medium/Specific Summary:** Capturing the core topic, entity, action, or expressed interest/opinion directly related to the interaction (e.g., "Advising on secured credit card payment strategy"). Should be "item-like" for recommendation relevance.
    *   **2. A Broad Summary:** Capturing the general category or domain the specific interaction falls under (e.g., "Personal Finance Management").
    *   **Rejection of "State-of-Being" Targets:** Explicit summaries like "Is an expert trader" will likely *not* be generated as targets; this state is expected to emerge implicitly in the embedding space based on consistent item/topic interactions and the pre-trained model's semantics.
*   **Motivation:** Providing both broad and specific signals per interaction explicitly teaches the student model the hierarchical relationship between detailed actions and general interests. This fosters better implicit clustering within the embedding space and supports recommendations at multiple levels of granularity. It is more natural for LLMs than generating only one specific level and better for recommendation than abstract state descriptions.

## 4. Expected Capabilities

*   **Assumption:** Training on the Q/A task will implicitly yield embeddings suitable for **Q/Q (User-User) similarity**.
    *   **Motivation:** Users with similar interests will interact with similar items/topics (`A`s), causing their embeddings (`Q`s) to converge in the shared semantic space. Similarity between user embeddings will thus reflect similarity in their learned interaction patterns and interests.
*   **Assumption:** The model will be capable of supporting **recommendations at varying levels of specificity** due to the hierarchical nature of the training targets.

This refined approach leverages the strengths of contextual data, LLM-based distillation, and pre-trained models to create versatile user embeddings suitable for nuanced recommendation tasks, while explicitly addressing design choices regarding context handling, target generation, and model architecture.

## 5. Student Model Architecture & Training

*   **Assumption:** A single, powerful pre-trained text encoder can effectively learn to map both user context representations and item/topic summaries into a shared semantic space.
*   **Approach (Architecture):** Employ a **single student encoder (bi-encoder)** architecture. This model will process both the user context input (`Q`) and the LLM-generated summaries (`A`, both positive and negative).
    *   **Motivation:** Aligns with modern practices (e.g., Gecko), offers parameter efficiency, enforces a unified semantic space directly, and effectively leverages pre-trained model capabilities.
*   **Approach (Base Model):** Start fine-tuning from a strong **pre-trained text embedding model**.
    *   **Motivation:** Provides foundational semantic understanding, enabling generalization to unseen but semantically related concepts/items/summaries, and implicitly capturing "states of being" based on interaction patterns.
*   **Approach (Context Window):** The student model must operate within a **defined small context window** (e.g., 8k-16k tokens). The input representation derived from the user's contextual history (`H_context` fed to the student) must adhere to this limit.
    *   **Motivation:** Ensures practical deployability and computational efficiency. The LLM teacher handles the distillation from potentially larger raw contexts into this constrained format.
*   **Approach (Training Objective):** The primary training objective will be a **Q/A (User-Item) contrastive task**. Given a user context (`Q`), the model learns to pull the relevant positive hierarchical summaries (`A_pos`) closer and push irrelevant negative summaries (`A_neg`) farther away in the embedding space.

### Corollary: Granular Teacher Processing Enables Holistic Student Learning

-   **Problem:** Processing a user's entire history at once for labeling individual interactions is often infeasible (context limits, cost) and can dilute the specific signal of the interaction being labeled.
-   **Teacher's Role (Granular Processing):** The "teacher" LLM acts as a highly sophisticated **feature extractor/event labeler** operating on individual interaction units (e.g., a comment within its thread context). It leverages its deep understanding of local context to generate high-fidelity, distilled representations (summaries, extracted points, tags) for *each interaction event* efficiently and scalably. It focuses on "what happened *here*?".
-   **Student's Role (Sequence Modeling & Compression):** The "student" model (likely Transformer-based) receives a **sequence** of these distilled representations or the original interaction units. Its strength lies in modeling sequences â€“ identifying patterns, dependencies, and recurring themes *across* the time-ordered inputs derived from the granular teacher outputs.
-   **Holistic Learning (e.g., Personality):** The student learns holistic concepts like personality, expertise, or stable interests by recognizing consistent patterns in the sequence of granular inputs. For example, if the teacher repeatedly extracts points related to "sarcasm" or "detailed financial advice" across many interaction units, the student's sequence modeling capabilities allow it to compress this recurring pattern into its final embedding. This embedding implicitly represents the emergent, holistic property (e.g., a sarcastic or financially knowledgeable personality).
-   **Conclusion:** This approach uses each model for its strength: the teacher for accurate local context analysis and feature extraction at scale, and the student for sequence modeling, temporal integration, and compression of patterns into a holistic user representation. Granular processing by the teacher enables the student to learn global properties.

## 6. Multi-Platform Strategy & Input Generalization 

*   **Initial Approach (Universal Representation):**
    *  Creating platform-specific parsers (starting with Reddit) that convert raw data into the defined **universal intermediate representation**.
    *   The student model will be trained *solely* on mapping this universal format to the semantic NL labels.
    *   **Benefit:** Simplifies the student model, promotes modularity (add new platforms by adding parsers), enforces a consistent input structure.
*   **Future Enhancement (Direct Multi-Format Training):**
    *   Extending the training data to include inputs from different sources potentially in *different formats* (e.g., Google search history). The NL labels generated by the teacher would remain the consistent semantic target.
    *   **Purpose:** To potentially capture richer interaction patterns found in diverse formats that are difficult to standardize perfectly, and to make the model robust to specific known input variations.
    *   **Generalization Caveat:** It is crucial to understand that training on multiple formats improves robustness and parsing capability *for those specific, trained formats*. It does **not** automatically grant the ability to parse or understand the structure of **completely novel, unseen input formats**. The primary source of *semantic* generalization (understanding new topics, comparing across sources) stems from the use of consistent, semantic **NL labels** as training targets.
