The broader goal of this project is to generate enough labels to build a contrastive dataset of around 10M records, which is but a small percentage of what we could extract from the raw data using the inferences from the LLMs you're judging.
For this reason there is no need to be harsh on the *recall* criteria such as exhaustiveness (if any); rather focus on *precision* and just make sure no major details are left out from the inferences.
